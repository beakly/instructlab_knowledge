# Saint Johns Clinical Practice Guidelines for Falls

Assess the patient, including an assessment of the features contained within the flag section.

## Flag

### Red flags

- Clinically significant injury.
- Clinically significant pain.
- Abnormal vital signs.
- Signs of stroke.
- Seizure without a history of epilepsy.
- Headache.
- New onset of visual disturbance.
- Unable to mobilise.
- Unstable medical condition contributing to the fall.

### Orange flags

- More than one fall in the last week.
- Postural hypotension.
- Seizure with a history of epilepsy.
- Recent change in medication.
- Minor injury requiring non-urgent treatment.
- New reduction in mobility but able to weight bear.

### Green flags

- Minor soft tissue injury not requiring medical treatment.
- Able to mobilise in a manner that is normal for the patient.

## General principles

- A patient that has fallen without a clear mechanical cause, for example a trip or slip, requires a thorough
history and clinical examination to rule out a cause for collapse.
- A patient that has fallen always requires an assessment to rule out injury, even if they appear to be
uninjured.
- Do not use the term ‘lift assist’ when referring to a patient that has fallen as this term should only be used
when a crew is assisting another crew to lift a patient.
- Falling is not a natural part of aging and all patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years who have
fallen require an assessment that considers referral to a falls prevention service.
- Have a raised index for suspicion of injury if the patient:
  - Has fallen a significant height, for example greater than one metre or five stairs in an adult, or
  - Is taking an anticoagulant or has a known bleeding disorder.
- Always take into account the patient’s comorbidities and social circumstances.
- Examples of unstable medical conditions contributing to the fall include diabetes with poor glucose
control and poorly controlled Parkinson’s disease. Clinical judgement is required when determining that a
medical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient’s GP.
- Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a
doctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for
example if soft tissue injury is present.
- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than
10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.

## Fall risk assessment

- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.
- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral
pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.
- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility
because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for
example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living
independently.
- Ask the patient the following questions:
  - Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?
  - Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?
  - Are there any activities you’ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?
- Perform Romberg’s test.
- Perform a timed up and go test.
- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:
  - The patient answered ‘yes’ to any of the questions, or
  - Romberg’s test is abnormal, or
  - The timed up and go test is abnormal, or
  - Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.
- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs,
mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient’s permission if feasible.

# Clinical Practice Guidelines for Documentation

## General principles

- Documentation must be accurate and complete.
- Comprehensive documentation is particularly important when a patient is not transported to a medical
facility.
- Documentation must be objective and subjective statements avoided. Take particular care to avoid
subjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family/whānau or other
healthcare professionals.
- As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if
something is not recorded it did not occur.
- A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.
- One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually
complete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the
documentation is accurate and complete.
- A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed. This includes for example, a separate PRF for a
mother and her newborn baby.

## Information documented in the Patient Report Form (PRF)

- The PRF must include all of the following:
  - The patient details (including NHI if possible).
  - The history and assessment of the patient.
  - A description of all significant treatment administered and/or interventions provided prior to
ambulance arrival.
  - All treatment administered and interventions provided by ambulance personnel or by people
assisting ambulance personnel, for example, PRIME responders.
  - A description of any clinical advice or information received.
  - At least one set of vital signs. See the ‘vital signs’ section for more information.
  - Known allergies to medicines.
- The PRF must contain all relevant information for the entire incident if the care and/or transport of the
patient is transferred from one crew to another.
- The use of abbreviations should be minimised.
- Terminology specific to ambulance personnel (for example R codes) must not be used
- When a patient is assessed following dispatch of an ambulance and not transported to a medical facility,
the documentation must include all the following:
  - The patient and incident details, the assessment, all treatment administered, all interventions
performed and at least one set of vital signs. See the ‘vital signs’ section for more information.
  - A clear description of the recommendation made to the patient and/or
family/whānau/guardians/caregivers, including why the recommendation was made.
  - A clear description of the communication between ambulance personnel and the patient and/or
family/whānau/guardians/caregivers if a recommendation to be transported to a medical facility by
ambulance is declined.
  - A competent patient or guardian must be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the
PRF if they decline a recommendation for transport to a medical facility by ambulance. They must not
be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the PRF if they are deemed not
competent to make decisions, or if a recommendation was made that transport to a medical facility
by ambulance was not required.
  - An electronic copy (or photograph) of the 12 lead ECG if one was acquired.
  - A completed non-transport pause and checklist.
- When a patient is not transported to a medical facility, advice on when to seek further clinical assessment
and/or treatment should be provided:
  - Advice should be provided in writing whenever this is feasible, for example using an ambulance care
summary (ACS) advice sheet.
  - Where applicable, information sheets (such as the concussion information sheet) must be provided.
  - Written advice should be photographed using the ePRF device.
  - Advice should be provided to:
    - The patient if they appear to be competent.
    - An appropriate person, for example a guardian or caregiver, if the patient appears to be not
competent.
    - A parent or guardian if the patient is a child

## Checking the PRF before it is finalised and submitted

- The PRF must be checked to ensure it is complete and accurate prior to it being finalised and submitted,
unless the crew are required to immediately respond to an urgent incident.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that assessed the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is checked
if the patient is not transported to a medical facility.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that transported the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is
checked.
- The PRF check must include confirmation that:
- All appropriate sections have been completed.
- The information is accurate and free of errors.
- The information adequately reflects all that occurred, in a manner that ensures a third party could
read the PRF and understand what happened.
- The discarding of controlled medicines that were drawn up but not administered is documented,
including documentation that this has been witnessed by a second crew member whenever possible.

# Audit Matrix Notes

## Introduction
The purpose of Parient Report Form (PRF) audit is not to be punitive or ‘picky’. The purpose of the PRF audit is to provide constructive
feedback in a way that supports learning and a culture that encourages staff to reflect on how clinical practice and documentation can be improved. Through PRF audit we wish to:
Identify documentation that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of documentation.
Identify clinical practice that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of clinical practice which improves patient safety and patient outcomes.
Identify clinical practice that is excellent or well above the expected standard and provide feedback. This provides positive feedback to personnel and raises morale and job satisfaction.
Identify clinical practice that is significantly unsafe and ensure that it is reported as a reportable event. This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.
Detect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.

## History and Examination
The history and examination must be recorded in a logical sequence.
The presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history must be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhoea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.
The presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination must be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.

## Chief Complaint/Clinical Impressions
The chief complaint/chosen clinical impressions including free text should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:
If the patient has an obvious fracture neck of the femur, this is more precise than leg pain.
If the patient has an inferior STEMI this is more precise than chest pain.

## Vital Sign Recordings
Not all vital signs must be recorded for all patients and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.
Two sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.

## Treatment
The treatment provided must be safe and by the CPGs.
In general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:
Does not align with the CPGs or
Appears below the expected standard or iii. Appears unsafe.
For paper PRFs:
All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.
Drugs must be recorded using generic names.
Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, morphine and not morphine sulphate.

## Scene Time
Focus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, for example, patients with STEMI, hypovolaemic shock or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.
For some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.
Focus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and/or family and complete documentation.

## Advice Received
Where crew have received advice from a doctor/nurse / PRIME / Clinical Desk or Air Desk the name of the person providing the advice, (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.

## Non-transport
When a single patient is assessed following dispatch of an ambulance and not transported to a medical facility, the documentation must include all the following:
The patient and incident details, the assessment, all treatment administered, all interventions performed and at least one set of vital signs. See the ‘vital signs’ section for more information.
A clear description of the recommendation made to the patient and/or family/guardians/caregivers, including why the recommendation was made.
Advice on when to seek further clinical assessment and/or treatment should be provided in writing whenever feasible.
Written advice should be photographed using the ePRF device.
A clear description of the communication between ambulance personnel and the patient and/or family/guardians/caregivers if a recommendation to be transported to a medical facility by ambulance is declined.
A competent patient or guardian must be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the ePRF if they decline a recommendation for transport to a medical facility by ambulance. They must not be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the ePRF if they are deemed not competent to make decisions, or if a recommendation was made that transport to a medical facility by ambulance was not required.
An electronic copy (or photograph) of the 12 lead ECG if one was acquired.
The red flags and checklists are not compulsory (other than the non-transport checklist). However, auditors should encourage personnel to use them. This must be done positively.

## Referral Decisions
It should be clear why the patient was transported.
The patient should be transported to the most appropriate medical facility, taking into account the anticipated healthcare needs of the patient and not necessarily to the closest medical facility.
Focus on patients that were status three or status four and provide feedback if they appear to have been inappropriately transported.
Provide feedback if the patient was transported to an ED if it appears the patient could have had their healthcare needs more efficiently met in a primary care setting.
Clarity of Documentation
Terminology specific to ambulance personnel, for example, R codes must not be used.
If abbreviations are used, they must be standard abbreviations and they must be used logically and their use minimised (see Abbreviations for use in Clinical Documentation 2018, available on the hub).
The PRF must contain all relevant information for the entire incident if the care and/or transport of the patient is transferred from one crew to another.

## Providing Positive Feedback
Provide positive feedback if the Ambulance personnel have done very well in a difficult situation or if the treatment provided is such that the Ambulance personnel were clinically excellent.
