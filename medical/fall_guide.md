# Falls

Assess the patient, including an assessment of the features contained within the red flag section.

## Red flags

- Clinically significant injury.
- Clinically significant pain.
- Abnormal vital signs.
- Signs of stroke.
- Seizure without a history of epilepsy.
- Headache.
- New onset of visual disturbance.
- Unable to mobilise.
- Unstable medical condition contributing to the fall.

## General principles

- A patient that has fallen without a clear mechanical cause, for example a trip or slip, requires a thorough
history and clinical examination to rule out a cause for collapse.
- A patient that has fallen always requires an assessment to rule out injury, even if they appear to be
uninjured.
- Do not use the term ‘lift assist’ when referring to a patient that has fallen as this term should only be used
when a crew is assisting another crew to lift a patient.
- Falling is not a natural part of aging and all patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years who have
fallen require an assessment that considers referral to a falls prevention service.
- Have a raised index for suspicion of injury if the patient:
  - Has fallen a significant height, for example greater than one metre or five stairs in an adult, or
  - Is taking an anticoagulant or has a known bleeding disorder.
- Always take into account the patient’s comorbidities and social circumstances.
- Examples of unstable medical conditions contributing to the fall include diabetes with poor glucose
control and poorly controlled Parkinson’s disease. Clinical judgement is required when determining that a
medical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient’s GP.
- Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a
doctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for
example if soft tissue injury is present.
- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than
10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.

## Fall risk assessment

- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.
- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral
pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.
- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility
because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for
example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living
independently.
- Ask the patient the following questions:
- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?
- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?
- Are there any activities you’ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?
- Perform Romberg’s test.
- Perform a timed up and go test.
- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:
  - The patient answered ‘yes’ to any of the questions, or
  - Romberg’s test is abnormal, or
  - The timed up and go test is abnormal, or
  - Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.
- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs,
mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient’s permission if feasible.

# Documentation

## General principles

- Documentation must be accurate and complete.
- Comprehensive documentation is particularly important when a patient is not transported to a medical
facility.
- Documentation must be objective and subjective statements avoided. Take particular care to avoid
subjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family/whānau or other
healthcare professionals.
- As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if
something is not recorded it did not occur.
- A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.
- One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually
complete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the
documentation is accurate and complete.
- A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed. This includes for example, a separate PRF for a
mother and her newborn baby.

## Information documented in the Patient Report Form (PRF)

- The PRF must include all of the following:
  - The patient details (including NHI if possible).
  - The history and assessment of the patient.
  - A description of all significant treatment administered and/or interventions provided prior to
ambulance arrival.
  - All treatment administered and interventions provided by ambulance personnel or by people
assisting ambulance personnel, for example, PRIME responders.
  - A description of any clinical advice or information received.
  - At least one set of vital signs. See the ‘vital signs’ section for more information.
  - Known allergies to medicines.
- The PRF must contain all relevant information for the entire incident if the care and/or transport of the
patient is transferred from one crew to another.
- The use of abbreviations should be minimised.
- Terminology specific to ambulance personnel (for example R codes) must not be used
- When a patient is assessed following dispatch of an ambulance and not transported to a medical facility,
the documentation must include all the following:
  - The patient and incident details, the assessment, all treatment administered, all interventions
performed and at least one set of vital signs. See the ‘vital signs’ section for more information.
  - A clear description of the recommendation made to the patient and/or
family/whānau/guardians/caregivers, including why the recommendation was made.
  - A clear description of the communication between ambulance personnel and the patient and/or
family/whānau/guardians/caregivers if a recommendation to be transported to a medical facility by
ambulance is declined.
  - A competent patient or guardian must be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the
PRF if they decline a recommendation for transport to a medical facility by ambulance. They must not
be asked to sign the ‘patient declined transport’ section of the PRF if they are deemed not
competent to make decisions, or if a recommendation was made that transport to a medical facility
by ambulance was not required.
  - An electronic copy (or photograph) of the 12 lead ECG if one was acquired.
  - A completed non-transport pause and checklist.
- When a patient is not transported to a medical facility, advice on when to seek further clinical assessment
and/or treatment should be provided:
  - Advice should be provided in writing whenever this is feasible, for example using an ambulance care
summary (ACS) advice sheet.
  - Where applicable, information sheets (such as the concussion information sheet) must be provided.
  - Written advice should be photographed using the ePRF device.
  - Advice should be provided to:
    - The patient if they appear to be competent.
    - An appropriate person, for example a guardian or caregiver, if the patient appears to be not
competent.
    - A parent or guardian if the patient is a child

## Checking the PRF before it is finalised and submitted

- The PRF must be checked to ensure it is complete and accurate prior to it being finalised and submitted,
unless the crew are required to immediately respond to an urgent incident.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that assessed the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is checked
if the patient is not transported to a medical facility.
- All clinical personnel in the crew that transported the patient are responsible for ensuring the PRF is
checked.
- The PRF check must include confirmation that:
- All appropriate sections have been completed.
- The information is accurate and free of errors.
- The information adequately reflects all that occurred, in a manner that ensures a third party could
read the PRF and understand what happened.
- The discarding of controlled medicines that were drawn up but not administered is documented,
including documentation that this has been witnessed by a second crew member whenever possible.
