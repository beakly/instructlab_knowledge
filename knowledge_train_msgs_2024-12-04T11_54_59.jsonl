Clinical judgement is required when determining that a medical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient\u2019s GP.\n* Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a doctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for example if soft tissue injury is present.\n* Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than 10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.\n\n## Fall risk assessment\n\n* Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.\n* Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.\n* Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living independently.\n* Ask the patient the following questions:\n\t+ Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?\n\t+ Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?\n\t+ Are there any activities you\u2019ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?\n* Perform Romberg\u2019s test.\n* Perform a timed up and go test.\n* Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:\n\t+ The patient answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions, or\n\t+ Romberg\u2019s test is abnormal, or\n\t+ The timed up and go test is abnormal, or\n\t+ Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.\n* Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling.

Take particular care to avoid subjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family\/wh\u0101nau or other healthcare professionals.\n* As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if something is not recorded it did not occur.\n* A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.\n* One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually complete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the documentation is accurate and complete.\n* A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed.

The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for example if soft tissue injury is present.\n* Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than 10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.\n\n## Fall risk assessment\n\n* Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.\n* Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral pathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.\n* Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility because the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for example a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living independently.\n* Ask the patient the following questions:\n\t+ Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?\n\t+ Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?\n\t+ Are there any activities you\u2019ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?\n* Perform Romberg\u2019s test.\n* Perform a timed up and go test.\n* Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:\n\t+ The patient answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions, or\n\t+ Romberg\u2019s test is abnormal, or\n\t+ The timed up and go test is abnormal, or\n\t+ Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.\n* Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs, mats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient\u2019s permission if feasible.\n\n# Documentation\n\n## General principles\n\n* Documentation must be accurate and complete.\n* Comprehensive documentation is particularly important when a patient is not transported to a medical facility.\n* Documentation must be objective and subjective statements avoided. Take particular care to avoid subjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family\/wh\u0101nau or other healthcare professionals.\n* As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if something is not recorded it did not occur.\n* A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.\n* One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually complete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the documentation is accurate and complete.\n* A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed. This includes for example, a separate PRF for a mother and her newborn baby.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a fall risk assessment?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe purpose of a fall risk assessment is to identify older patients at risk of a fall and refer them to a falls referral pathway, which reduces the risk of further falls and injury.\n","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"sdg_document\": \"# Falls\\n\\nAssess the patient, including an assessment of the features contained within the flag section.\\n\\n## Flag\\n\\n### Red flags\\n\\n* Clinically significant injury.\\n* Clinically significant pain.\\n* Abnormal vital signs.\\n* Signs of stroke.\\n* Seizure without a history of epilepsy.\\n* Headache.\\n* New onset of visual disturbance.\\n* Unable to mobilize.\\n* Unstable medical condition contributing to the fall.\\n\\n### Orange flags\\n\\n* More than one fall in the last week.\\n* Postural hypotension.\\n* Seizure with a history of epilepsy.\\n* Recent change in medication.\\n* Minor injury requiring non-urgent treatment.\\n* New reduction in mobility but able to weight bear.\\n\\n### Green flags\\n\\n* Minor soft tissue injury not requiring medical treatment.\\n* Able to mobilize in a manner that is normal for the patient.\\n\\n## General principles\\n\\n* A patient who has fallen without a clear mechanical cause, for example a trip or slip, requires a thorough history and clinical examination to rule out a cause for collapse.\\n* A patient who has fallen always requires an assessment to rule out injury, even if they appear to be uninjured.\\n* Do not use the term 'lift assist' when referring to a patient who has fallen as this term should only be used when a crew is assisting another crew to lift a patient.\\n* Falling is not a natural part of aging and all patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years who have fallen require an assessment that considers referral to a falls prevention service.\\n* Have a raised index for suspicion of injury if the patient:\\n\\t+ Has fallen a significant height, for example greater than one metre or five stairs in an adult, or\\n\\t+ Is taking an anticoagulant or has a known bleeding disorder.\\n* Always take into account the patient\\u2019s comorbidities and social circumstances.\\n* Examples of unstable medical conditions contributing to the fall include diabetes with poor glucose control and poorly controlled Parkinson\\u2019s disease.

Clinical judgement is required when determining that a\nmedical condition requires review in an ED or review by the patient\u2019s GP.\n- Clinical judgement must be used to determine when a patient with orange flags should be seen by a\ndoctor. The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for\nexample if soft tissue injury is present.\n- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than\n10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.\n\n## Fall risk assessment\n\n- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.\n- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral\npathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.\n- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility\nbecause the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for\nexample a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living\nindependently.\n- Ask the patient the following questions:\n- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?\n- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?\n- Are there any activities you\u2019ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?\n- Perform Romberg\u2019s test.\n- Perform a timed up and go test.\n- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:\n  - The patient answered \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the questions, or\n  - Romberg\u2019s test is abnormal, or\n  - The timed up and go test is abnormal, or\n  - Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.\n- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling.

Through PRF audit, we aim to:\n\n* Identify documentation that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of documentation.\n* Identify clinical practice that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of clinical practice, which improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Identify clinical practice that is excellent or well above the expected standard and provide feedback. This provides positive feedback to personnel and raises morale and job satisfaction.\n* Identify clinical practice that is significantly unsafe and ensure that it is reported as a reportable event.

This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination should be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history should be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination should be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions, including free text, should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\n\n* If the patient has an obvious fracture of the neck of the femur, this is more precise than \u201cleg pain.\u201d\n* If the patient has an inferior STEMI, this is more precise than \u201cchest pain.\u201d\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients, and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and according to the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback. Feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\n\n* Does not align with the CPGs,\n* Appears below the expected standard, or\n* Appears unsafe.\n\nFor paper PRFs:\n\n* All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\n* Drugs must be recorded using generic names.\n* Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, use \u201cmorphine\u201d instead of \u201cmorphine sulphate.\u201d\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family, and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor, nurse, PRIME, Clinical Desk, or Air Desk, the name of the person providing the advice (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat should be the focus when evaluating scene time in the PRF?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis.

For example, recording the absence of diarrhea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination should be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions, including free text, should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible.

For example:\n\n* If the patient has an obvious fracture of the neck of the femur, this is more precise than \u201cleg pain.\u201d\n* If the patient has an inferior STEMI, this is more precise than \u201cchest pain.\u201d\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients, and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and according to the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback, and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\n\n* Does not align with the CPGs,\n* Appears below the expected standard, or\n* Appears unsafe.\n\nFor paper PRFs:\n\n* All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\n* Drugs must be recorded using generic names.\n* Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, use \u201cmorphine\u201d instead of \u201cmorphine sulphate.\u201d\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family, and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor, nurse, PRIME, Clinical Desk, or Air Desk, the name of the person providing the advice (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the PRF audit to identify and report unsafe clinical practice?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe PRF audit is used to identify and report unsafe clinical practice to improve patient safety and patient outcomes.

This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Detect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination should be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history should be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination should be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions, including free text, should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\n\n* If the patient has an obvious fracture of the neck of the femur, this is more precise than \u201cleg pain.\u201d\n* If the patient has an inferior STEMI, this is more precise than \u201cchest pain.\u201d\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients, and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and according to the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback, and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\n\n* Does not align with the CPGs,\n* Appears below the expected standard, or\n* Appears unsafe.\n\nFor paper PRFs:\n\n* All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\n* Drugs must be recorded using generic names.\n* Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, use \u201cmorphine\u201d instead of \u201cmorphine sulphate.\u201d\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family, and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor, nurse, PRIME, Clinical Desk, or Air Desk, the name of the person providing the advice (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the history and examination section in the PRF?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe history and examination section in the PRF should be recorded in a logical sequence, and the presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history and physical examination should be recorded.

Through PRF audit, we aim to:\n\n* Identify documentation that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of documentation.\n* Identify clinical practice that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of clinical practice, which improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Identify clinical practice that is excellent or well above the expected standard and provide feedback. This provides positive feedback to personnel and raises morale and job satisfaction.\n* Identify clinical practice that is significantly unsafe and ensure that it is reported as a reportable event. This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Detect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination should be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history should be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination should be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions, including free text, should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\n\n* If the patient has an obvious fracture of the neck of the femur, this is more precise than \u201cleg pain.\u201d\n* If the patient has an inferior STEMI, this is more precise than \u201cchest pain.\u201d\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients, and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and according to the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback, and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\n\n* Does not align with the CPGs,\n* Appears below the expected standard, or\n* Appears unsafe.\n\nFor paper PRFs:\n\n* All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\n* Drugs must be recorded using generic names.\n* Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, use \u201cmorphine\u201d instead of \u201cmorphine sulphate.\u201d\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time.

The purpose of the PRF audit is to provide constructive\nfeedback in a way that supports learning and a culture that encourages staff to reflect on how clinical practice and documentation can be improved. Through PRF audit we wish to:\nIdentify documentation that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of documentation.\nIdentify clinical practice that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of clinical practice which improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\nIdentify clinical practice that is excellent or well above the expected standard and provide feedback. This provides positive feedback to personnel and raises morale and job satisfaction.\nIdentify clinical practice that is significantly unsafe and ensure that it is reported as a reportable event. This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\nDetect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination must be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history must be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhoea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination must be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions including free text should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\nIf the patient has an obvious fracture neck of the femur, this is more precise than leg pain.\nIf the patient has an inferior STEMI this is more precise than chest pain.\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and by the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\nDoes not align with the CPGs or\nAppears below the expected standard or iii. Appears unsafe.\nFor paper PRFs:\nAll treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\nDrugs must be recorded using generic names.\nDrug compounds must not be recorded. For example, morphine and not morphine sulphate.\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, for example, patients with STEMI, hypovolaemic shock or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor\/nurse \/ PRIME \/ Clinical Desk or Air Desk the name of the person providing the advice, (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat should be recorded in the chief complaint\/clinical impressions section of the PRF?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe chief complaint\/clinical impressions section of the PRF should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible.

This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination must be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history must be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhoea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination must be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions including free text should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\nIf the patient has an obvious fracture neck of the femur, this is more precise than leg pain.\nIf the patient has an inferior STEMI this is more precise than chest pain.\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and by the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\nDoes not align with the CPGs or\nAppears below the expected standard or iii. Appears unsafe.\nFor paper PRFs:\nAll treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\nDrugs must be recorded using generic names.\nDrug compounds must not be recorded. For example, morphine and not morphine sulphate.\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, for example, patients with STEMI, hypovolaemic shock or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor\/nurse \/ PRIME \/ Clinical Desk or Air Desk the name of the person providing the advice, (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat should be documented in the chief complaint\/clinical impressions section?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe chief complaint\/clinical impressions should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example, if the patient has an obvious fracture neck of the femur, this is more precise than leg pain.

This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\nDetect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination must be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history must be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhoea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination must be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions including free text should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\nIf the patient has an obvious fracture neck of the femur, this is more precise than leg pain.\nIf the patient has an inferior STEMI this is more precise than chest pain.\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and by the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\nDoes not align with the CPGs or\nAppears below the expected standard or iii. Appears unsafe.\nFor paper PRFs:\nAll treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\nDrugs must be recorded using generic names.\nDrug compounds must not be recorded. For example, morphine and not morphine sulphate.\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, for example, patients with STEMI, hypovolaemic shock or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor\/nurse \/ PRIME \/ Clinical Desk or Air Desk the name of the person providing the advice, (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\n\nWhat is the role of the PRF audit in promoting a culture of continuous improvement?\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>\nThe PRF audit promotes a culture of continuous improvement by providing constructive feedback to healthcare providers and identifying areas for improvement. The audit helps raise the general standard of clinical practice and documentation, which in turn improves patient safety and patient outcomes. The audit also detects and reports trends, which can be used to make system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"sdg_document\": \"# Audit Matrix Notes\\n\\n## Introduction\\nThe purpose of Parient Report Form (PRF) audit is not to be punitive or \\u2018picky\\u2019.

For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\\n\\n## Treatment\\nThe treatment provided must be safe and by the CPGs.\\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\\nDoes not align with the CPGs or\\nAppears below the expected standard or iii. Appears unsafe.\\nFor paper PRFs:\\nAll treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\\nDrugs must be recorded using generic names.\\nDrug compounds must not be recorded. For example, morphine and not morphine sulphate.\\n\\n## Scene Time\\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, for example, patients with STEMI, hypovolaemic shock or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family and complete documentation.\\n\\n## Advice Received\\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor\/nurse \/ PRIME \/ Clinical Desk or Air Desk the name of the person providing the advice, (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.\", \"dataset_type\": \"base_document\"}","id":"69cd5da8-04e4-45d4-9d77-4eb3de50a8ef"}

The 24 hour timeframe is a maximum and many patients should be seen sooner than this, for\\nexample if soft tissue injury is present.\\n- Postural hypotension is present if there is a fall of greater than 20 mmHg in the systolic BP or greater than\\n10 mmHg in the diastolic BP when standing.\\n\\n## Fall risk assessment\\n\\n- Falls are a common cause of injury and loss of independence in older patients.\\n- Ambulance personnel have an important role in referring older patients at risk of a fall to a falls referral\\npathway, as this reduces the risk of further falls and injury.\\n- Referral to a falls referral pathway is not required if the patient is living in an aged residential care facility\\nbecause the facility personnel are required to manage this. Patients living in an independent unit (for\\nexample a villa) in the same complex as an aged residential care facility are designated as living\\nindependently.\\n- Ask the patient the following questions:\\n- Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year?\\n- Do you need to use your hands to get out of a chair?\\n- Are there any activities you\\u2019ve stopped doing because you are afraid of falling?\\n- Perform Romberg\\u2019s test.\\n- Perform a timed up and go test.\\n- Refer the patient to a falls referral pathway if:\\n  - The patient answered \\u2018yes\\u2019 to any of the questions, or\\n  - Romberg\\u2019s test is abnormal, or\\n  - The timed up and go test is abnormal, or\\n  - Personnel consider the patient is at risk of falling.\\n- Examine the environment for hazards which may contribute to the risk of falling. Examples include rugs,\\nmats, cords and poor footwear. Eliminate these hazards with the patient\\u2019s permission if feasible.\\n\\n# Documentation\\n\\n## General principles\\n\\n- Documentation must be accurate and complete.\\n- Comprehensive documentation is particularly important when a patient is not transported to a medical\\nfacility.\\n- Documentation must be objective and subjective statements avoided. Take particular care to avoid\\nsubjective statements about the behaviour or demeanour of the patient, their family\/wh\\u0101nau or other\\nhealthcare professionals.\\n- As a general rule, a third party (for example, The Health and Disability Commissioner) will assume that if\\nsomething is not recorded it did not occur.\\n- A third party should be able to read the documentation and understand what happened and why.\\n- One person will usually lead the patient assessment and treatment and this person should usually\\ncomplete the PRF. However, all clinical personnel in the crew are responsible for ensuring the\\ndocumentation is accurate and complete.\\n- A separate PRF is required for each patient assessed. This includes for example, a separate PRF for a\\nmother and her newborn baby.\", \"dataset\": \"document_spellcheck\", \"domain\": \"fall_assessment\"}","id":"3562f5ed-5894-40d7-a420-0bce94856640"}

This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination must be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history must be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhoea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination must be recorded.

Through PRF audit, we aim to:\n\n* Identify documentation that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of documentation.\n* Identify clinical practice that is below the expected standard and provide feedback. This helps personnel to learn and raises the general standard of clinical practice, which improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Identify clinical practice that is excellent or well above the expected standard and provide feedback. This provides positive feedback to personnel and raises morale and job satisfaction.\n* Identify clinical practice that is significantly unsafe and ensure that it is reported as a reportable event. This improves patient safety and patient outcomes.\n* Detect and report trends. This provides the Clinical Audit and Research Team with information that is used to support system changes that improve patient safety and patient outcomes.\n\n## History and Examination\nThe history and examination should be recorded in a logical sequence.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the history should be recorded. For example, recording the absence of diarrhea is pertinent if the patient is vomiting, but it is not pertinent if the patient has chest pain.\nThe presence or absence of pertinent aspects of the physical examination should be recorded. For example, the absence of abdominal tenderness is pertinent if the patient has abdominal pain, but it is not pertinent if the patient has a stroke.\n\n## Chief Complaint\/Clinical Impressions\nThe chief complaint\/chosen clinical impressions, including free text, should describe the clinical problem in the most precise way possible. For example:\n\n* If the patient has an obvious fracture of the neck of the femur, this is more precise than \u201cleg pain.\u201d\n* If the patient has an inferior STEMI, this is more precise than \u201cchest pain.\u201d\n\n## Vital Sign Recordings\nNot all vital signs must be recorded for all patients, and details of the expectations are in the CPGs.\nTwo sets of vital signs are expected for most patients who are not transported, noting that clinical judgment is required. For example, two sets of vital signs are not expected for a patient with a minor injury but would be expected for a patient with abdominal pain.\n\n## Treatment\nThe treatment provided must be safe and according to the CPGs.\nIn general, a difference in opinion on what treatment should have been provided is insufficient to provide feedback, and feedback should only be provided if the treatment:\n\n* Does not align with the CPGs,\n* Appears below the expected standard, or\n* Appears unsafe.\n\nFor paper PRFs:\n\n* All treatments and clinical interventions must be recorded in chronological order within the treatment section.\n* Drugs must be recorded using generic names.\n* Drug compounds must not be recorded. For example, use \u201cmorphine\u201d instead of \u201cmorphine sulphate.\u201d\n\n## Scene Time\nFocus on the scene time for patients with a time-critical condition, such as patients with STEMI, hypovolemic shock, or stroke within a time window that would allow thrombolysis. In these patients, scene times that are well below twenty minutes are expected unless there is an extrication problem that prolongs the scene time.\nFor some patients, the time to clinical intervention is more important than the scene time. Examples include patients in cardiac arrest and patients receiving rapid sequence intubation.\nFocus on inappropriately short scene times if the patient is not transported. In this setting, the scene time should be appropriate considering the requirement to perform an assessment, communicate with the patient and\/or family, and complete documentation.\n\n## Advice Received\nWhere crew have received advice from a doctor, nurse, PRIME, Clinical Desk, or Air Desk, the name of the person providing the advice (their registration number if appropriate) and the advice received should be documented within the ePRF, preferably using the advice received tool.","role":"pretraining"}],"metadata":"{\"dataset_type\": \"spellcheck\", \"raw_document\": \"# Audit Matrix Notes\\n\\n## Introduction\\nThe purpose of Parient Report Form (PRF) audit is not to be punitive or \\u2018picky\\u2019.
